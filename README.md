# Person-Project
This is the first project I completed in the Spring of 2021 during my CS201 class. 

The goal of this project was to:
  1. Create a simple Java class and modify two driver programs to demonstrate understanding of classes, methods, and instance variables.
  2. Create a text file that is read by a Java program.
  3. Learn about using Git for project management.
